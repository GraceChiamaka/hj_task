# Welcome to the Frontend Engineer Task!

This **README** file contains the instructions you will need to complete your task in the form of
a User Story – the format regularly used by Hotjar engineers in our weekly sprints.

#### Instructions

- This master branch already contains code which you will use for your task. Please add any new code to a 
- new feature branch. When you’re done with the task, please submit a GitLab merge request to master.

- If you cannot satisfy all the acceptance criteria within the given timeframe, simply prioritize what 
- you feel is important and mention what you have excluded and why in your README file (*widget/README.md*).

- For the parts of the task which you feel are unclear, we encourage you to make your own 
- assumptions as long as they are documented in your README file  (*widget/README.md*). 
- However, if you have a question or concern that is blocking you from completing the work, 
- please reach out to us via email.

A week after your task start date, a Hotjar engineer will review your merge request and 
you will receive an email within 48 hours notifying you of the next steps.

### User Story

As a Hotjar user, I want to be able to create a funnel using an in-page widget on my own site.

#### Why are we doing this?

Our users currently configure Hotjar funnels by manually writing the URLs or a CSS selector 
they wish to track (for example: visit to www.site.com, click on *#purchase-button* in www.site.com/product, 
visit to www.site.com/cart). Hotjar would then use this data to populate a funnel report and 
show how many users are dropping off between each step.

In an effort to improve the user experience for our users, we would like to implement an in-app widget that 
would load on users’ websites and allow them to select the pages and elements directly from their site. 
This would also decrease the amount of funnel report failures due to users writing the URLs or CSS selectors incorrectly.

#### Design Prototype

[Design link](https://www.figma.com/file/f5naBOjKqoog2jhHvM5gfj/Front-end-Engineering-task?node-id=1%3A141)

#### Acceptance Criteria

-   For each new step, the user can:
    -   Add the current URL
    -   Add an element from the page by bringing up a selector that allows you to visually highlight and 
    -   select the element you want to add, providing the following options when it’s clicked:
        -   Any element:
            1.  **Viewed** - Meaning at any point in time it was visible in the view-port 
   (such as scrolling down and seeing the element).
            1.  **Clicked** - Any time an element such as an `<a>, <div>, <img>, <button>`, etc is clicked.
        -   Form elements which support key press events (`<input type=”[text/password/email/etc.”>`, `<textarea>`):
            1.  **Key pressed** or **filled** - Meaning an element had its value changed.
            2.  **Focus** - Meaning an element received focus from the user.
        -   Form elements which support change events (`<select>`, `<input type=”[checkbox/radio]”>`):
            1.  **Change** - Whenever the element was changed.
-   A “**Save funnel**” button that sends the collected data by calling the submit() function from the 
-   @api package. Please set the element *id* to be “**save-funnel**”.
-   An “**X**” close button that closes the widget when clicked. Please set the element *id* to be “**close-widget**”.
-   The widget should maintain state across multiple pages and remember the steps throughout the session.
-    This will allow users to navigate their site and build a funnel that could consist of multiple page URLs.

#### Important Notes

- The Acceptance Criteria is the source of truth, not the design. 
- There is a supplied design that shows the intended experience / visuals for the widget itself - the rest is up to you.
- You can use your own boilerplate.
- You should not use any third-party libraries that end up in the output bundle.
    - You're still allowed to use TypeScript as a compiler or testing libraries like Jest.
- You can change any code, but the code review will be only done in `widget/src/` folder and on `widget/README.md` file.
- For this boilerplate to run, you will need to run `npm install; npm start` in both `demosite/` and `widget/` 
- and make sure that the 3000 and 3001 ports are available.

### Good luck!
